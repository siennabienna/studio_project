# Week 1

## Deciding on the theme ***Digital Folklore***
- I want to explore the origins of how computer culture has developed
- In my past experiments in the workshop tasks assignment, I enjoyed using humour, and I feel like I could connect this with internet identity and the idea of a 'meme'
- Online social spaces have always fascinated me, and I love to analyse the origins of trends on Tik Tok and Instagram from an outsiders perspective, and how different comminuties have developed to be the way that they are today
- I want to be able to reference to the early stages of online internet spaces - a crucial part of the development of modern technology culture
- In the workshop tasks, one thing that sparked this idea was using the old MS Paint background on the webcam art for workshop 9
- As my audience for this project is an internet audience, I want to be able to make these specific references that only this audience will understand
- I'm fascinated by how the internet was really the first 'place' on earth where people from comepletely different countries, cultures, identites and personalities could come together though shared interests on forums - it was a a way for personal expression to thrive without the confines of real life
- I want to explore the ways the artspace found itself on the internet - art was freed from the exclusivity of the art world and was avalible to make and view by anyone with an internet connection for the first time ever
- As someone who belives in the deinstitutionalization of art, this sounded like something I am willing to explore myself - I want to create some sort of artwork that can be viewed, changed, and understood by anyone in the world dispite economic or educational background

One of the first viral internet memes - Dancing Baby (1996)

## Ways I would like to Explore this Theme
- Making references to the internet at a crucial stage of its development - not only in the visual aspects, but also how it is coded
- Use some type of humor that will tie it to both the origins of computer art - but also perhaps in a way that a modern internet audience would still find it humourous
- References to wider culture in the world at the moment, communicated by early internet imagery - eg, the Trump assasination attempt shown through pixelated images (perhaps like an online version of Rauschenberg)
- Not try to convey a storyline, but more an idea or feeling

## Ideas for Code
- Some sort of interactive sketch using the user imput events learned in workshop tasks, perhaps similar to an old online forum (like very early Facebook, perhaps the user is able to navigate between different 'profiles' that all work together to discuss some type of modern day subject like AI)
- A gallery type sketch of memories - showing parts of the early internet that has significant impacts (such as the development of URLs or the beginning of code), or perhaps things that shaped me and my internet journey (things like club penguin, early youtube, cool math games, and maybe a reference to my parents old computer that had a very loud fan and would heat up horribly) - The gallery could be a mixture of images, text, and interactive aspects like letting the user draw all over it with a pen tool
- A desktop screensaver type of page where each icon could be opened into a new piece of interactive art - some might have silly old GIFs, some might have just text, some might have images relevant to current culture (but made to fit in the theme by turning them into GIFs or using pixels)
