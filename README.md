## Deciding on My Theme
After watching the live classes, I decided on the theme of 'digital folklore'. This theme interested me because I want to explore the origins of how computer culture has developed. In my past experiments in the workshop tasks assignment, I enjoyed using humour, and I feel like I could connect this with internet identity and the idea of a 'meme'. Online social spaces have always fascinated me, and I love to analyse the origins of trends on Tik Tok and Instagram from an outsiders perspective, and how different comminuties have developed to be the way that they are today. I want to be able to reference to the early stages of online internet spaces - a crucial part of the development of modern technology culture. In the workshop tasks, one thing that sparked this idea was using the old MS Paint background on the webcam art for workshop 9. As my audience for this project is an internet audience, I want to be able to make these specific references that only this audience will understand.

Another part of this that fascinates me is how the internet was really the first 'place' on earth where people from comepletely different countries, cultures, identites and personalities could come together though shared interests on forums. It was a a way for personal expression to thrive without the confines of real life. This also translates into how the artspace found itself on the internet - art was freed from the exclusivity of the art world and was avalible to make and view by anyone with an internet connection for the first time ever. As someone who belives in the deinstitutionalization of art, this sounded like something I was willing to explore myself. I want to create some sort of artwork that can be viewed, changed, and understood by anyone in the world dispite economic or educational background.
